This script fits log-normal Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and ARIMA models to salmon run-size data with or without regression covariates. These models are then used to generate one-year-ahead forecasts. The data used to fit the models is split into "training" and "validation" sets to evaluate performance of the one-year-ahead forecasts, compare models, and develop weighted "ensemble" forecasts. Weights may be generated using multiple methods including optimized "stacking weights" which are guaranteed to produce an ensemble with performance at least as good as the best individual ensemble member.
