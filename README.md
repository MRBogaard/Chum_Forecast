This script fits log-normal Generalized Additive Models and ARIMA models to salmon run-size data with or without regression covariates. These models are then used to generate one-year-ahead forecasts. The data used to fit the models is split into "training" and "validation" sets to evaluate performance of the one-year-ahead forecasts, compare models, and develop weighted "ensemble" forecasts.
